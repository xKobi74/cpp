## How to build the project: 

* mkdir build
* cd build

## How to run the project:

After building the project there are three files in *build* folder: a.out, test.out.

Use *a.out* to run program

+ Input: "count of triangles" "three points' coordinates (first triangle)" "three points' coordinates (second triangle)" "...."
+ Output: 
* "number N1 of triangle that is intersected"
* "number N2 of triangle that is intersected" 
* "....""

---
+ Use *test.out* to run auto test program
