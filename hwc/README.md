# 2Q and "Perfect" cache algorithms

## How to build the project: 

* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make 

---

## How to run the project:

After building the project there are three files in *build* folder: qq.out, perf.out, all.out, test.out.

+ Use *qq.out* to run 2Q algorithm
+ Use *perf.out* to run Perfect algorithm
+ Use *all.out* to run 2Q and Perfect algorithm  
Input: "count of requests" "first file number" "second file number" "...."
Output: "count of cachehits"

---
+ Use *test.out* to run auto test program
